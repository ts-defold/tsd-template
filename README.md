# Defold Typescript
A dev environment for Defold that transpiles TypeScript into lua using typescript-to-lua.
This 🗝 turnkey Defold TypeScript dev environment features:
> ⭐ .vscode folder based project  
> ⭐ lua-types and defold-types for autocomplete and inline docs  
> ⭐ eslint with sane typescript defaults  
> ⭐ patched typescript-to-lua to generate *.script files

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

To get started simply use `npm run` and get going!
> ✔ Use `npm run dev` to start a watcher that compiles and emits lua and script when you save  
> ✔ Use `npm run build` to just compile your ts, sans watcher  

**We ❤ TypeScript!**
